Source code and data presented in "Causal reasoning over knowledge graphs leveraging drug-perturbed and disease-specific transcriptomic signatures for drug discovery".

## Structure

- `data`: contains the four transcriptomic datasets used in the paper as well as the two KGs. Furthermore, it contains the drug-disease pairs studied in clinical trials which are used as positive pairs for the validation of the RPath algorithm.
- `notebooks`: contains the code to run the algorithm and its validation as well as its analysis.
